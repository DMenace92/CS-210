# CS-210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
for this assignment I choose the project 3. for project 3 the scenario was a grocery store has had a list of produce that was sold throughout the day. what I had to do was create a program that 
will iterate through the list manipulate the date for analysis. for example, for the first part of the project we needed to filter through the list of the txt file and display the number of occurrences of
the given item alongside the item itself.

What did you do particularly well?
On this project I believe I done particularly well in handling the data from the txt file to present the proper requirement that was required for this project on the best of my ability upon learning a new programming language.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
the areas I need to improve on that I had trouble with is understanding the syntax errors that occur while building. Also, understanding the use and implementation of pointers on C++. For this project it was not a requirement but if 
implemented it would have made the program run much more smoothly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
the challenging aspect of programming this project was coding with python along with C++. I have taken a Python class while back when I had no experience on that language. creating functions in python I had to dig deep into my brain to
remember the syntax. As to the syntax I remembered how crucial it is to maintain proper indentation of each code block to prevent syntax errors.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
working on this project having the understanding an ability to connect two different language was very exciting for me. In the future I would love to develop games as a hobbyist having the knowledge the practice this term will be very beneficial. and most importantly working
with C++ this term will improve my skills with other languages and libraries I utilize on my side project like the UX libraries from React.js

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
the way I can make a program readable is by incorporating spacing between lines of code with the implementation of comments explaining what the code block functionality is. keeping a program 
Maintained is checking for vulnerabilities if there is any sign of deprecated packages or libraries that needs updating.
