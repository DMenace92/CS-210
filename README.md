# CS-210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
for this assignement i choose the project 3. for poject 3 the sinario was a grocery store has had a list of produce that was sold through out the day. what i had to do was create a program that 
will iterate through the list manipulate the date for analysis. for example for the first part of the project 

What did you do particularly well?
On this poject I believe i done particularly well in handeling the data from the txt file to present the proper requirement that was required for this project on the best of my ability upon learnging a new programming language.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
the areas i need to imporve on that i had truble with is undersanding the syntax errors that occure while building. Also undersanting the use and implimentation of pointers on C++. For this project it was not a requirement but if 
implamented it would have made the program run much more somthly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
the challenging aspect of programming this project was coding with python along with C++. I have taken a Python class while back when I had no experience on that language. creating functions in python I had to dig deep into my brain to
remember the syntax. As to the syntax i remembered how crucial it is to maintain proper indentation of each code block to prevent syntax errors.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
working on this project having the understanding an ability to connect two diffrent language was very exciting for me. In the future i would love to develop games as a hobbiest having the knoledge the practice this term will be very bennifical. and most importantly working
with C++ this term will improve my skills with other languages and libraries i utilize on my side project like the UX librarys from React.js

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
